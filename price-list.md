# Note: 

You can get an extra servo motor as this makes coding much eaiser than the oginal car above, which uses a DC motor for turning and a potentiometer to determine what angle the motor is at.

## Note that Microcontrollers improve rapidly. 

Here is the changing list. The 2021 Portenta should last us a few years.   
(Any of the below materials would work fine, just we will be able to do much more with the latest equipment the Portenta and Vision Shield)

## 2021 Microcontroller Price List   
When we combine the PortentaH7 with the LoRa vision shield we have a great Machine Learning duo. But it is expensive.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5605614/133374592-36bb6dfd-ec10-4796-b998-782b58ce8730.png" width=400 /> [Arduino LoRa Vision Shield](https://store-usa.arduino.cc/products/arduino-portenta-vision-shield-lora%C2%AE) $63.25 USD  Allows the Portenta to See and hear and use the LoRaWan networks


<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5605614/133946385-f768bd3b-60fd-44ec-92c6-80e3bbd6cf6d.png" width=100 /> [Seeedstudio Grove 128x64 OLED Display](https://www.robotshop.com/ca/en/seeedstudio-grove-128x64-oled-display.html?gclid=Cj0KCQjwv5uKBhD6ARIsAGv9a-yFXp7cpk2qEBbJ-mKO3dtvo5_8n0M5hqiUZE1wPE7RPDKo6fMhjfsaApVREALw_wcB)  $19.10 CDN   Needed to see what the Portenta sees

Optional:

[Charmed Labs Pixy2 Machine Learning Color cam](https://www.robotshop.com/ca/en/charmed-labs-pixy-21-cmucam5-image-sensor.html) $76.97 CDN   This already has Machine Learning in it and detects different shades, (black and white are not a shade). Can really easily do very complex things, and it is fast.

This board made around 2018 has Machine Learning ability and an accelerometer. A great starting choice for Machine Learning, however it is lacking when using the color camera below since the resolution size can only be 48 x 48 pixels.

This board made in 2015 is still a great microcontroller today, but only with limited Machine Learning capability


# Optional Sensor Kit: Consider getting one of the many Arduino style sensor kits on the market. Here is one for $35 CDN that looks very good

[Kuman 37-in-1 Sensor Kit Compatible with Arduino Raspberry Pi Mega 2560 Kits Compatible K5](https://www.amazon.ca/Kuman-sensor-arduino-raspberry-Compatible/dp/B01BY16552/ref=sr_1_29?dchild=1&keywords=maker+breadboard+wire+kit+solder&qid=1631683832&sr=8-29)

# Final Product


This is what it looks like when it is all finished. A robot controlled or app controlled Toy Car.
