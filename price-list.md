Everone needs the [Big VNH5019 Motor Driver Carrier](https://www.pololu.com/product/1451) $44.95 USD


And these plugs [WSD1302 plug set](https://www.rcsuperstore.com/ws-deans-2-pin-ultra-plug-set-one-male-one-female-included/) $2.99 USD



(Do not get the more expensive brushless version as the coding is much more difficult)

Note: You can get an extra servo motor as this makes coding much eaiser than the roginal car above. 
Extra [3 wire Servo ](https://www.rcpro.ca/collections/shredder/products/shredder-3-wires-19gram-metal-gear-servo) $24.99 CDN

If you don't get the 3 wire servo you need this [DRV8835 Dual Motor Driver Carrie](https://www.pololu.com/product/2135) from Pololu $9.95 USD

## Note that Microcontrollers get better rapidly. Here is the changing list. The 2021 Portenta should last for a few years.

## 2021 Microcontroller Price List
When we combine the PortentaH7 with the LoRa vision shield we have a great Machine Learning duo. But it is expensive.
[Arduino PortentaH7](https://store-usa.arduino.cc/products/portenta-h7)  $103.40 USD

[Arduino LoRa Vision Shield](https://store-usa.arduino.cc/products/arduino-portenta-vision-shield-lora%C2%AE) $63.25 USD

Optional: [Charmed Labs Pixy2 Machine Learning Color cam] (https://www.robotshop.com/ca/en/charmed-labs-pixy-21-cmucam5-image-sensor.html) $76.97 CDN

## 2020 Microcontroller Price List

[arduino-nano-33-ble-sense-with-headers](https://store-usa.arduino.cc/products/arduino-nano-33-ble-sense-with-headers) $33.40 USD

This board made around 2019 has Machine Learning ability and an accelerometer. A great starting choice for Machine Learning, however it is lacking when using the color camera below since the resolution size can only be 48 x 48 pixels.

[ov7670 Camera](https://electropeak.com/ov7670-camera-board-b-waveshare) $13.29 USD

## 2019 Microcontroller Price List

[Particle Photon](https://store.particle.io/products/photon)  $19.65 USD
This board made in 2015 is still a great microcontroller today, but only with limited Machine Learning capability
